# A curated list of my favorites projects

Here you can find some of my creations, each one showcasing a different concept of frontend development.

Take a look at the live projects and navigate to the github repositories to see the source code and a more in depth description of the projects.

Oh and by the way...
this README can be edited, write in the raw markdown and see the changes re-render as you type.
